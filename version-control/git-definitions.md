# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

** What is version control?  Why is it useful? **
Version control is a tool that keeps track of changes in a file, and allows more than one person to work on it. Version control is useful because you can revert back to an older copy if something goes awry while you are working on the file

** What is a branch and why would you use one? **
A branch is a copy of the file you want to work on. This is done to make changes without damaging the master file. 
** What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? **
A commit is a saving point for a project that you're working on. A good commit message will describe what changes were made in the file. 

** What is a merge conflict? **
A merge conflict happens when two or more people edit the same line in a file. This can usually be prevented by communicating better as a team!
