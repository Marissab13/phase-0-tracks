Word Game Pseudocode

Build a class called Game that can hold methods

Build a enter_word method that allows one user to enter a word and store the word

Build a  guess_number method that looks at the length of the word and sets the guesses amount to that number 

Build a guess_counter method that counts the number of guesses the user has done
This method should not count repeated guesses, only new guesses

Build a get_letter method that will take a letter as a guess and check it against the word
If the letter is in the word, the user will see the letter and blanks where they need to guess the others. If the letter is incorrect, guess count +1 and an error message should appear. 

Build a method that will give the user a congratulations method or a taunting message depending on if they win or lose.
