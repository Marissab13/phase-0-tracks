##COOKIES
	A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website, and it's stored on a user's computer by a web browser. They are passed as HTTP headers. A webserver can request that your browser creates a cookie. Then the webserver can read and write content from and to the file. This sounds dangerous, but web servers can only access cookies in their own domain. there is also a limit to the amount of cookies each domain can have.
