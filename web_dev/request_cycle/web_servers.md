##The Philosophy of Linux
		Linux is an open source software and it was created to be an free and open source version of UNIX. 

	Below is a list of nine major tenents of Linux I found on opensource.com:
	1. Small is beautiful
	2. Each program does one thing well
	3. Prototype as soon as possible
	4. Choose portability over efficiency
	5. Store data in flat text files
	6. Use software leverage
	7. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability
	8. Avoid captive user intervaces
	9. Make every program a filter 

##VPS Advantages
	A VPS is easier to configure than a physical server. It's cheaper as well, and user-friendly. If you have a VPS, you have superuser-level access, meaning you can install any type of software you want that can be run on the OS. 

##Root user - good idea, or bad idea? 
	According the the research that I did on the subject, it's a bad idea to run programs as the root user. First off, there is nothing to stop you from damaging the system. Usually, a user would have to enter a 'sudo' command, which makes them stop and think before executing something that could be harmful. Second, all applications will run with root privilege which mean that vulnerabilities in other software can destroy your system by allowing viruses in.
