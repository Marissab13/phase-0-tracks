Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

To research Jquery, my plan is this: 
	- look at Team Treehouse videos
	- look on Youtube for Jquery tutorials
	- look at online documentation 


Treehouse was really good, but it took awhile to wach all of the videos. 

The same goes for Youtube - finding tutorials that were easy to understand and that were under 20 minutes was time consuming

Reading online documentation was more helpful than I thought it would be (since I'm a visual learner) but I found a lot of useful information
